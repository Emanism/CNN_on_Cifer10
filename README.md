# Convolutional Neural Networks on CIFAR-10 Dataset

# Overview
This repository contains an end-to-end walkthrough of training a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) on the CIFAR-10 dataset. CIFAR-10 is a well-known collection of images used for object recognition, partitioned into a training set of 50,000 images and a test set of 10,000 images, spread across ten distinct classes.

# Dataset Overview
The CIFAR-10 dataset comprises 60,000 32x32 color images distributed equally across ten classes such as airplanes, cars, birds, cats, etc. This project utilizes the dataset to train a CNN model for image classification tasks, ensuring a balanced dataset with a uniform distribution of classes both in training and testing sets.

# Model Implementation
The CNN model is implemented using Keras with TensorFlow as backend, featuring layers like Conv2D for convolutional operations and MaxPool2D for downsampling. The model includes dense layers with dropout to reduce overfitting and is compiled using categorical crossentropy loss and the Adam optimizer for efficient training.

# Preprocessing Steps
The project includes preprocessing steps like one-hot encoding of class labels and normalization of image data to bring pixel values between 0 and 1. Reshaping is done to align the data with the input requirements of Keras.

# Training and Evaluation
The CNN model is trained over multiple epochs, demonstrating the impact of increased complexity and longer training times on performance. The repository documents the training process with model summaries and performance metrics after each epoch. The model's accuracy and loss on the test set are evaluated to provide insights into its generalization capabilities.

# Classification Report
A detailed classification report is generated, presenting precision, recall, and F1-scores for each class. It highlights the model's performance across various classes, identifying areas where the model excels and others where improvement is needed.

# Model Enhancement
Additional model modifications, including the adjustment of convolutional layers and the addition of dropout layers, are explored to improve the model's performance. The repository describes the rationale behind these changes and their impact on the model's accuracy.

# Conclusion
The project concludes with a reflection on the model's performance, with an emphasis on precision, recall, and F1-score consistency across different classes. It also suggests potential improvements and future work to increase the model's accuracy, particularly in classes where the model currently underperforms.
